Loftin. The Pensacola Journal became a daily in 1898. With competition at home in Pensacola, the newspaper's coverage included a large part of Florida. In 1922, the Pensacola Journal was purchased by John H. Perry, who in 1924 purchased the newspaper's rival, the Pensacola (FL) Evening News. For the next six decades, the Pensacola Journal continued to appear mornings and the Pensacola News evenings. Both newspapers remained extremely competitive. A combined Sunday edition published as the Pensacola (FL) News Journal [LCCN sn00059018] also became available. A consolidated newspaper, also known as the Pensacola (FL) News Journal [LCCN sn87062269] continued operations beginning June 3, 1985. This daily continues to this day (ca. 2008). Pensacola, Florida is the seat of government for Escambia County (FL); the western most city in the western most county of Florida. The city sits on Pensacola Bay, connecting to the Gulf of Mexico. Since the early colonial period, Pensacola had been an important naval port and economic center. By 1889, the city was already one of Florida's four largest cities. In 1890, Pensacola numbered 11,750 souls. The big news of 1898 was the beginning of the Spanish American War. Pensacola's Gulf Coast port, like others in Florida, hosted forces bound for Cuba, among them Teddy Roosevelt who passed through Pensacola on his way to Cuba through Tampa. Throughout the first decade of the 20th century, Pensacola experienced tremendous growth. By 1900, Pensacola had grown to 17,747 citizens. And, it increased another thirty percent by 1910, to 22,982 citizens. During the decade, following the Spanish American War, the United States of America secured the peace it had won over the Spanish in the Caribbean through naval patrols and maneuvers based out of Pensacola. From 1908 onward through the mid-century, Pensacola experienced urban expansion. 1908 saw the completion of a new Spanish Renaissance City Hall. 1910 witnessed the completion of the American National Bank building; at 10 stories, Pensacola's first skyscraper. 1910 also marked the construction of the San Carlos Hotel and a wooden bridge across Bayou Texar. By 1912, Pensacola had 21 miles of paved streets. Pensacola's first modern hospital, Pensacola Hospital, opened in 1915.

Collins as the Weekly True Democrat [LCCN: sn95047417], Milton A. Smith bought the newspaper in 1908. A weekly, the newspaper published under that name until mid-February, 1912, when it began publishing as the Semi-weekly True Democrat [LCCN: sn95047418]. In 1913, it reverted to a weekly again under the title the Weekly True Democrat [LCCN: sn95047419]. On April 6, 1915, when the newspaper began daily publication, its name changed again, this time simply to the Daily Democrat [LCCN sn96027226]. The new name lasted only for a brief time. Frequency of publication would yet again dictate a change of title. So, in 1915 as well, the newspaper became the Weekly Democrat [LCCN: sn95047420]. Sometime thereafter, exact dates are not known, the newspaper became the paper of record for the state's capital and the title changed yet again briefly to reflect. Now the newspaper carried the title, the Weekly Democrat and Florida Record [LCCN: not known to exist]. If ever it was a record for Florida, it would have been a digest as both the Florida House and Senate have maintained continuous and detailed recordings of their deliberations. Lloyd C. Griscom, became owner in 1929, when again the newspaper became known as the Daily Democrat [LCCN sn96027229]. The newspaper retained this title for twenty years. In 1949, it became the Tallahassee (FL) Democrat [LCCN sn83005708]. And on March 1, 1965, the Tallahassee Democrat was purchased by Knight Newspapers, Inc. The newspaper retains the title Tallahassee Democrat to this day (ca. 2008). All of this might have been simplified had the newspaper stuck to the alternate title that it used in Volume 1, Issue number 1. The \"True Democrat\", as it then briefly called itself, explained that its name showed dedication to \"true and tried doctrines of The Old Time Democracy ... as distinguished from ... mischievous fads and fallacies of the day.\" Though not intended, never more true words have been spoken on newspaper title changes! The True Democrat, whatever its name, would come to influence, and some might argue, make mischief with, the State of Florida's democratic processes and the deliberations of the legislature. While it may have shown leanings toward one party or another throughout its history, the newspaper has been affiliated with neither the Democratic nor Republican party but can be said to have exerted its opinions on each. Because Tallahassee is the seat of Florida's state government, the True Democrat has been quoted copiously in many journal articles and theses. Of particular note is its usefulness in tracking Jim Crow behaviors in the early 20th century. During this period the Black population in Leon County was about 80% and the white supremacists felt threatened. Three works lend themselves to such analyses:  Ortiz, Paul.

It continued to be published in Gainesville, Florida. In 1938, the Gainesville Daily Sun merged with the Alachua County (FL) News [LCCN: sn96027436] to form the Gainesville Daily Sun and the Alachua County News [LCCN: sn95026980]. The Daily Sun and the Gainesville Daily Sun both were self-described as \"democratic\" papers. Gainesville Daily Sun, like its predecessor, was published daily, except Mondays, by Henry Hamilton McCreary. H.H. McCreary is one of the best researched of Florida's newspaper publishers; documentation is maintained by the Florida Historical Society. In brief, McCreary came from a well established southern family, with prominent relatives throughout his contemporary American South. Following the completion of a degree from the University of Kentucky, McCreary established himself as a newspaper editor at the age of twenty. Throughout his publishing career, he also rose to prominence as a politician in the Democratic Party, first as a City Councilman and later as a member of the State Assembly, re-elected several times. McCreary considered himself a staunch patriot. He fervently supported industrialization as a means of strengthening Florida and the Nation. McCreary's wife, born Irene Richardson, was well connected in Gainesville and northeast Florida's civic networks as well. She served, for a time, both as Vice President of the Florida Federation of Women's Clubs and president of the United Daughters of the Confederacy. Between 1903 and 1938, Gainesville's moderate phosphate, turpentine and tung oil industries made room for the industry that, today (ca. 2008) drives the Gainesville economy. In 1905, when the Florida Legislature sited the University of Florida, the State's college for men, in Gainesville, the city was known for its good drinking water and lack of other drink or activities that might get young men into trouble. The University offered its first classes in Gainesville in 1906, having relocated from its previous home in Ocala (FL). Along with its move, its mission had also changed, broadened from that of the East Florida Seminary that it had been. University population and offerings grew steadily over time. Women were admitted, albeit under limiting circumstances, for the first time in 1925. The University of Florida would not see its next growth spurt until after World War II.

The St. Lucie County Tribune was the Fort Pierce News' younger rival, the News being two years older than the Tribune. Fort Pierce (FL) is a city in St. Lucie County (FL) and sits on the Indian River astride Florida's Atlantic Ocean coast. It was incorporated in 1901 and named as the new county's seat of government in 1905. St. Lucie County was formed in 1905 from southern Brevard County (FL). Between 1917 and 1925, various parts of St. Lucie County were separated to form Okeechobee County (FL), Martin County (FL), and Palm Beach County (FL). Fishing was key to the early economy of the City of Fort Pierce. Pineapple was the agricultural king of St. Lucie County from the turn of the 20th century until its collapse following World War I. Fort Pierce News reports on river traffic and the occasional steamboat groundings, the birth of St. Lucie County, and nearby Indian reservations, etc. With the advance of the railroads into southern Florida along Atlantic coast routes, additional reporting is given to rail lines and tourism.

Loftin. The Pensacola Journal became a daily in 1898. With competition at home in Pensacola, the newspaper's coverage included a large part of Florida. In 1922, the Pensacola Journal was purchased by John H. Perry, who in 1924 purchased the newspaper's rival, the Pensacola (FL) Evening News. For the next six decades, the Pensacola Journal continued to appear mornings and the Pensacola News evenings. Both newspapers remained extremely competitive. A combined Sunday edition published as the Pensacola (FL) News Journal [LCCN sn00059018] also became available. A consolidated newspaper, also known as the Pensacola (FL) News Journal [LCCN sn87062269] continued operations beginning June 3, 1985. This daily continues to this day (ca. 2008). Pensacola, Florida is the seat of government for Escambia County (FL); the western most city in the western most county of Florida. The city sits on Pensacola Bay, connecting to the Gulf of Mexico. Since the early colonial period, Pensacola had been an important naval port and economic center. By 1889, the city was already one of Florida's four largest cities. In 1890, Pensacola numbered 11,750 souls. The big news of 1898 was the beginning of the Spanish American War. Pensacola's Gulf Coast port, like others in Florida, hosted forces bound for Cuba, among them Teddy Roosevelt who passed through Pensacola on his way to Cuba through Tampa. Throughout the first decade of the 20th century, Pensacola experienced tremendous growth. By 1900, Pensacola had grown to 17,747 citizens. And, it increased another thirty percent by 1910, to 22,982 citizens. During the decade, following the Spanish American War, the United States of America secured the peace it had won over the Spanish in the Caribbean through naval patrols and maneuvers based out of Pensacola. From 1908 onward through the mid-century, Pensacola experienced urban expansion. 1908 saw the completion of a new Spanish Renaissance City Hall. 1910 witnessed the completion of the American National Bank building; at 10 stories, Pensacola's first skyscraper. 1910 also marked the construction of the San Carlos Hotel and a wooden bridge across Bayou Texar. By 1912, Pensacola had 21 miles of paved streets. Pensacola's first modern hospital, Pensacola Hospital, opened in 1915. And, in 1916, the city began operating its first motorized fire truck, and, had replaced all of its horse-drawn firefighting equipment by 1924. Since then through World War II, the history of Pensacola has been one of boom and bust. It underwent renewal and renewed growth following World War II.--E.
